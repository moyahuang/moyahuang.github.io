abstract: "A component is the basic unit of Tibetan characters, and component decomposition of Tibetan characters is a fundamental step for Tibetan informatization. According to the character formation rules and writing features in the vertical and horizontal dimensions of Tibetan characters, a matrix-based algorithm for the component decomposition of Tibetan characters is proposed. Firstly, the algorithm decomposes Tibetan characters in vertical and horizontal dimensions, based on their structural features and writing order. Secondly, it goes to decomposition each dimension respectively. Finally, 48 different structures of modern Tibetan characters were tested. The test results show that the accuracy of the algorithm reaches 100%."
