abstract: "Free hand interaction with devices is a promising trend with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT). The unmodulated ambient light, which can be an exciting modality for interaction, is still deficient in research and practice when most of the efforts in the field of visible light sensing are put into solutions based on modulated light. In this paper, we propose a low-cost ambient light-based system which performs finger gesture recognition in real-time. The system relies on a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture without complicated pre-processing algorithms for the gesture classification task. The results of experimental evaluation proves that the solution that we put forward achieves a rather high recognition accuracy with our proposed sensor layout across a certain group of users."
