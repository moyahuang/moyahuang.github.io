The unmodulated ambient light, which can be an exciting modality for interaction, is still deficient in research and practice when most of the efforts in the field of visible light sensing are put into solutions based on modulated light. In this paper, we propose a low-cost ambient light-based system which performs finger gesture recognition in real-time. The system relies on a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture without complicated pre-processing algorithms for the gesture classification task. The results of experimental evaluation proves that the solution that we put forward achieves a rather high recognition accuracy with our proposed sensor layout across a certain group of users.","authors":["Miao Huang","Haihan Duan","Yanbing Yang"],"booktitle":null,"id":0,"publication":"IEEE INFOCOM 2020 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","publishDate":"2020-07-06T00:00:00Z","shorttitle":null,"tags":null,"title":"Demo Abstract: FingerLite: Finger Gesture Recognition Using Ambient Light","uri":"https://moyahuang.github.io/zh/publication/article/3/"},{"ENTRYTYPE":"patent","abstract":"本发明涉及手势识别技术领域,目的在于提供低成本、高准确度的基于环境光的手势识别系统和方法,可以克服同类系统对于光源的要求,使用场景更加丰富。采用的技术方案为：包括数据采集终端、手势识别服务器和应用端,数据采集终端包括多个光电接收器、信号放大模块、模数转换模块和信号处理模块；光电接收器用于捕捉手势动作产生的光信号变化,光电接收器输出端分别与信号放大模块的输入端相连,信号放大模块的输出端与模数转换模块的输入端相连,模数转换模块的输出端与信号处理模块输入端相连,信号处理模块处理后的数据信息传输至手势识别服务器中进行识别,手势识别服务器输出识别信息并发送至应用端,应用端将识别信息进行实时展示。","authors":["黄苗","段海涵","杨彦兵"],"booktitle":null,"id":1,"publication":"","publishDate":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","shorttitle":null,"tags":null,"title":"一种基于环境光的手势识别系统和方法","uri":"https://moyahuang.github.io/zh/publication/misc/1/"},{"ENTRYTYPE":"journal paper","abstract":"As an essential requirement of pervasive smart devices, free hand gestural input considered as necessary for user interactions has attracted lots of research attention for nearly decades. Nevertheless, existing proposals heavily rely on either expensive pre-deployed equipment or user on-body sensors, thus confine their application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel hand gesture recognition system which purely relies on ubiquitous ambient light and low-cost photodiodes. The proposed system does not need any modification to existing lighting infrastructure. While without complex signal pre-processing for modulated light, very low-cost photodiodes and processors can capture and process the light variations caused by hand gesture. To produce accurate hand gesture recognition, we design efficient algorithms based on recurrent neural network to process sensing data collected by a photodiode array. We implement a prototype consisting of an array of 8 photodiodes and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution can achieve a very high overall recognition accuracy of 99.31%.","authors":["Haihan Duan","Miao Huang","Yanbing Yang"],"booktitle":null,"id":2,"publication":"IEEE Access","publishDate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","shorttitle":null,"tags":null,"title":"Ambient Light Based Hand Gesture Recognition Enabled by Recurrent Neural Network","uri":"https://moyahuang.github.io/zh/publication/article/2/"},{"ENTRYTYPE":"conference paper","abstract":"A component is the basic unit of Tibetan characters, and component decomposition of Tibetan characters is a fundamental step for Tibetan informatization. According to the character formation rules and writing features in the vertical and horizontal dimensions of Tibetan characters, a matrix-based algorithm for the component decomposition of Tibetan characters is proposed. Firstly, the algorithm decomposes Tibetan characters in vertical and horizontal dimensions, based on their structural features and writing order. Secondly, it goes to decomposition each dimension respectively. Finally, 48 different structures of modern Tibetan characters were tested. The test results show that the accuracy of the algorithm reaches 100%.","authors":["Chenshuo","Miao Huang"],"booktitle":null,"id":3,"publication":"IEEE INFOCOM 2020 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","publishDate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00Z","shorttitle":null,"tags":null,"title":"A Matrix-based component decomposition algorithm of Tibetan characters","uri":"https://moyahuang.github.io/zh/publication/article/1/"}]
